## üß† DSA Questions (20)  

### üåü Easy  
1. **Union of Two Sets**  
   - Problem: Find the union of two arrays and return the count of unique elements.  
   - Approach: Use a `HashSet` to store unique elements from both arrays.  
   - Complexity: O(n + m)  

2. **Reverse a Linked List**  
   - Problem: Reverse a singly linked list.  
   - Approach: Use three pointers (prev, curr, next) to reverse links.  
   - Complexity: O(n)  

3. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**  
   - Problem: Remove duplicates in-place from a sorted array.  
   - Approach: Use two pointers to update the array in-place.  
   - Complexity: O(n)  

4. **Palindrome String**  
   - Problem: Check if a given string is a palindrome.  
   - Approach: Compare the string with its reverse.  
   - Complexity: O(n)  

5. **Middle of a Linked List**  
   - Problem: Find the middle element of a linked list.  
   - Approach: Use slow and fast pointers.  
   - Complexity: O(n)  

6. **Two Sum - Pair with Given Sum**  
   - Problem: Find two numbers that add up to a given target.  
   - Approach: Use a hash map to store the complement.  
   - Complexity: O(n)  

7. **Find Missing in Second Array**  
   - Problem: Find elements present in the first array but missing in the second.  
   - Approach: Use XOR to find the difference.  
   - Complexity: O(n)  

8. **Count the Characters**  
   - Problem: Count the frequency of each character in a string.  
   - Approach: Use a frequency map.  
   - Complexity: O(n)  

9. **Palindrome**  
   - Problem: Check if an integer is a palindrome.  
   - Approach: Reverse the number and compare.  
   - Complexity: O(d)  

10. **Sort in Specific Order**  
    - Problem: Sort the array with odd numbers in ascending and even numbers in descending order.  
    - Approach: Separate odds and evens, then sort independently.  
    - Complexity: O(n log n)

### üöÄ Medium  
11. **Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists**  
    - Problem: Merge two sorted linked lists into one.  
    - Approach: Use two pointers to compare elements and merge.  
    - Complexity: O(n + m)  

12. **Kadane's Algorithm**  
    - Problem: Find the maximum sum subarray.  
    - Approach: Dynamic Programming with current and max sum.  
    - Complexity: O(n)  

13. **Spirally Traversing a Matrix**  
    - Problem: Print the matrix in a spiral order.  
    - Approach: Use boundaries (top, bottom, left, right) to traverse.  
    - Complexity: O(n * m)  

14. **Word Break (Trie)**  
    - Problem: Check if a string can be segmented into dictionary words.  
    - Approach: Trie + Dynamic Programming.  
    - Complexity: O(n^2)  

15. **Permutations of a String**  
    - Problem: Print all permutations of a given string.  
    - Approach: Recursion + Backtracking.  
    - Complexity: O(n!)  

16. **LRU Cache**  
    - Problem: Design an LRU cache using LinkedHashMap.  
    - Approach: Use a doubly linked list and a hash map.  
    - Complexity: O(1) for get and put.  

17. **Snake and Ladder Problem**  
    - Problem: Minimum dice throws to reach the end.  
    - Approach: Breadth-First Search (BFS) on a graph.  
    - Complexity: O(n)  

18. **Coin Change (Count Ways)**  
    - Problem: Find the number of ways to get a sum using coins.  
    - Approach: Dynamic Programming.  
    - Complexity: O(n * m)  

19. **Longest Palindromic Substring**  
    - Problem: Find the longest palindromic substring.  
    - Approach: Expand around the center.  
    - Complexity: O(n^2)  

20. **Gas Station**  
    - Problem: Find the starting gas station to complete the circuit.  
    - Approach: Greedy Algorithm.  
    - Complexity: O(n)
